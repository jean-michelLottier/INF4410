_THE WORKS OF_

NORMAN DUNCAN

_Second Edition_

The Mother

    A Novelette of New York Life. 12mo, cloth, $1.25, de
    Luxe, $2.00 net.

    "Another book quite unlike 'Dr. Luke' in environment,
    but very like it in its intuitive understandings of the
    natures of the lowly and obscure . . . holds the reader
    spellbound."--_Nashville American._


_Twenty-fifth Thousand_

Doctor Luke of the Labrador

    12mo, cloth, $1.50.

    "Norman Duncan has fulfilled all that was expected
    of him in this story; it established him beyond
    question as one of the strong masters of the present
    day."--_Brooklyn Eagle._


_Fourth Edition_

Dr. Grenfell's Parish

    Illustrated. Cloth, $1.00 net.

    "He tells vividly and picturesquely many of the things
    done by Dr. Grenfell and his associates. They have
    a distinct literary tone. It is splendid, heroic
    work that Dr. Grenfell and his fellows are doing as
    missionaries of humanity and civilization in a field
    that is painfully near home."--_N. Y. Sun._
